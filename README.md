  Collaborate with Anton to get stuff done.

## How it works

Anton is your coworker that's excellent at many things — research, email, lead gen, data work, and yes, coding too.

```
anton run "find 50 leads in the fintech space and put them in a spreadsheet"
anton run "draft responses to the 12 unread support emails"
anton run "research competitors in the AI agent space and summarize findings"
anton run "build a script that syncs our CRM with the billing system"
```

You don't write code. You don't manage prompts. You just tell Anton what you need done — the same way you'd ask a coworker — and he figures out the rest. If it needs code, he writes it. If it needs research, he does it. If it needs both, he handles that too.

He plans the approach, executes, and learns from every task so he gets sharper over time.

You focus on the *what*. Anton handles the *how*.

## Install

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindsdb/anton/main/install.sh | sh
```

## Quick start

```bash
anton run "summarize yesterday's sales calls and email me the highlights"
```

That's it. Anton takes it from there.

## Why "Anton"?

If you've seen *Silicon Valley*, you know.

Gilfoyle's AI — **Son of Anton** — was an autonomous system that wrote code, made its own decisions, and occasionally went rogue in spectacular fashion. It was named after [Anton LaVey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_LaVey), because of course Gilfoyle would name his creation after the founder of the Church of Satan.

We kept the name. Dropped the "Son of." Same energy — an autonomous agent that writes code and thinks for itself. Hopefully with fewer satanic undertones. No promises.
